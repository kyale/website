Subject: Application for EVC Procedure (Erkenning van Verworven Competenties) – ICT & Software Architecture
To: The Admissions Board / EVC Assessment Committee Date: [Current Date] From: Iman Ghatami (Chalky Web B.V.)
Dear Members of the Assessment Committee,
With this letter and the attached portfolio, I formally apply for an EVC (Recognition of Acquired Competencies) procedure to validate my 17+ years of professional experience against the Dutch national standards for Higher Professional Education (HBO/WO) in Informatics.
Currently operating through my firm, Chalky Web B.V., I have spent nearly two decades at the forefront of the Dutch and international software industry. My career has evolved from a foundational role in infrastructure to senior architectural positions at industry leaders such as APM Terminals (Maersk), Rabobank, TomTom, and Enreach.
I believe my professional record demonstrates the core competencies required for a Bachelor/Master of ICT in the following areas:
Architectural Mastery: I have moved beyond code implementation to system design, successfully applying complex patterns like Domain-Driven Design (DDD), CQRS, and Event Sourcing to modernize legacy platforms at Enreach.
Global Impact & Innovation: At APM Terminals, I took strategic responsibility for a navigation system now deployed in over 10 terminals worldwide. This project required not only technical excellence in Kotlin but also the ability to assess business feasibility and introduce cost-saving open-source solutions.
Security & Ethical Responsibility: My background as an Ethical Hacker and my implementation of complex IAM (Identity & Access Management) protocols at TomTom demonstrate a level of "Security by Design" that exceeds standard academic requirements.
Technical Leadership: Having served as a Technical Lead and Product Owner, I possess the soft skills and organizational oversight necessary to lead multidisciplinary teams in Agile environments, bridging the gap between high-level business goals and technical execution.
My motivation for this EVC procedure is to formalize my extensive practical knowledge. While my career successes at organizations like Ahold Delhaize and Rabobank speak to my capabilities, I am eager to align my "Life-Long Learning" journey with the official Dutch educational framework. This will allow me to continue contributing to the Netherlands' tech ecosystem at a strategic level, specifically within the fields of AI/ML and Decentralized Systems.
Enclosed is my Portfolio of Evidence, including my Competency Mapping Table and Self-Assessment Essay, which further detail my alignment with the HBO-i domain description.
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my experience further during the intake interview.
Sincerely,
Iman Ghatami Senior Software Engineer & Technical Lead Chalky Web B.V.
