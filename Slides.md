The Script: "Good morning/afternoon. My name is Iman Ghatami. Today, I am presenting my professional journey—not just as a developer, but as a Software Architect and Ethical Hacker who has spent 17 years designing complex, secure, and highly scalable distributed systems. My focus today is to demonstrate how my hands-on experience at companies like APM Terminals and TomTom aligns with the highest Dutch professional standards."

Slide 2: The 17-Year Evolution (2 Minutes)
Visual: A horizontal timeline in Neutral Gray with Cyber Mint markers.
2007-2008: Foundations in Infrastructure (Webair)
2009-2016: Scaling Web Platforms (Daisycon, Focum)
+1
2016-2020: The Transition to Architecture (Enreach)
2020-Present: High-Impact Freelancing (Rabobank, Ahold, APM Terminals)
+4
The Script: "My career began at the infrastructure level with Webair, where I managed server provisioning and networking. This foundation evolved into a decade of leading high-traffic web platforms. Over the last 7+ years, I have specialized in the Kotlin ecosystem, architecting microservices that handle everything from global logistics to secure banking payments."

Slide 3: The Tech Stack Matrix (2 Minutes)
Visual: Three distinct "Badges" using JetBrains Mono font for technical terms.
Languages: Kotlin (7+ yrs), Java (10+ yrs), PHP (10+ yrs)
Frameworks: Spring Boot, Axon (CQRS/ES), Ktor, Kubernetes
Security: IAM, OAuth 2.0, SAML 2.0, Ethical Hacking tools
The Script: "My technical arsenal is built on versatility and depth. I bring over 10 years of Java experience and have spent the last 7+ years as an early adopter and specialist in Kotlin for production environments. I operate comfortably across the full lifecycle—from designing DDD-based microservices to managing private and public Kubernetes clusters."

Slide 4: Case Study - Global Impact at APM Terminals (4 Minutes)
Visual: A world map highlighting 10+ locations.
Challenge: Optimizing routes for terminal trucks globally.
Solution: Built a Kotlin-based navigation system using open-source components.
Result: Reduced fuel consumption and improved efficiency at 10+ global terminals.
The Script: "At APM Terminals, I acted as a Senior Software Engineer with a strategic focus. I identified project bottlenecks early and introduced a solution leveraging open-source components to streamline delivery. I led the Kotlin development for a navigation system that now optimizes container handling efficiency on a global scale—directly impacting Maersk’s operational efficiency and fuel consumption."

Slide 5: Case Study - Architecture & Security (4 Minutes)
Visual: Split screen. Left: Monolith to Microservices diagram. Right: Security/IAM flow.
Architectural Mastery: Applied DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing at Enreach.
The Security Lens: Built SAML/OAuth 2.0 identity systems at TomTom.
The Guardian: Ethical hacking and platform assessment.
The Script: "At Enreach, I led the transformation of a telecom platform from a monolith to a microservices architecture using DDD and Event Sourcing. This wasn't just technical; it was about modeling complex business domains. At TomTom, I applied this to security, building IAM systems that support mutual TLS and OAuth 2.0 to secure millions of navigation devices. My perspective is unique because I also view systems as an Ethical Hacker, ensuring security is baked in, not bolted on."

Slide 6: Leadership & Soft Skills (1 Minute)
Visual: Cyber Mint text block.
Roles: Technical Lead, Product Owner, Team Lead
Mentorship: Guided teams in Málaga and the Netherlands
Process: Facilitated Event Storming and Agile workflows
The Script: "Technical excellence requires leadership. I have led diverse teams across Europe, bridging the gap between business goals and technical execution in my roles as a Product Owner and Lead Engineer. My goal is always to foster best practices in software design and architecture within my teams."

Slide 7: Conclusion & Professional Reflection (1 Minute)
Visual: Large, bold text: "Architecting the Future."
Focus: AI/ML for optimization, Blockchain for security.
The Goal: Validating 17 years of experience through the EVC process.
The Script: "In conclusion, my career is a testament to continuous learning and the ability to deliver high-impact, secure software at a global scale. As I explore the applications of AI and Blockchain for the future, I am confident that my track record at Enreach, TomTom, and Maersk reflects the professional level of an HBO/WO-educated Software Architect. Thank you for your time."
